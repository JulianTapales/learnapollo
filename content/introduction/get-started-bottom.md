## Choose your Tutorial Track

Now that you got your own GraphQL server, let's get familiar with the general structure of an exercise.

Each exercise is based on a feature-oriented **goal**, like the possibility to list all pokemons or to add a new pokemon.
You can follow along the several **steps** that are provided to finish the exercise. Exercises focus on different 
**concepts** of Apollo Client which will be explained as soon as we encounter them with a short **recap** of the 
most important parts at the end of the exercise.

create a Pokedex App together!
